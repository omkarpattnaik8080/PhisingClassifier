# PhisingClassifier

This project aims to build a machine learning-based classifier that detects phishing websites or emails. By analyzing features such as URLs, domains, and message content, the model classifies instances as either phishing or legitimate.

## Project Overview
Phishing is a form of cyber attack where attackers attempt to deceive users into providing sensitive information. This project focuses on developing a machine learning classifier to detect phishing attempts based on features such as URLs, email content, and domain information.

The classifier is trained on labeled datasets, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and is designed for real-time integration into email clients or browser extensions.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Phishing and legitimate URL or email datasets.
- **Feature Extraction**:
  - URL length, presence of suspicious keywords, special characters.
  - Domain age, WHOIS data, IP geolocation.
  - Content-based features for email analysis.
- **Modeling**:
  - Uses classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forests, SVM, deep learning).
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Real-time phishing detection.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional for deep learning)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phishing-classifier.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Collect or download phishing and legitimate URLs/emails datasets.
2. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 92%
- **Precision**: 91%
- **Recall**: 90%
- **F1-score**: 90%

## Future Improvements
- Enhance feature engineering with more complex patterns.
- Implement real-time phishing detection through APIs or browser extensions.
- Address emerging phishing techniques using adaptive learning.
